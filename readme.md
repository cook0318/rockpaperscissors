TO DO:

Style page with color and centering

Make Opponent choice outside of box, or atleast disappear

Could do something where it cycles through all 3 options of opponent choices, and after 2 seconds slows down and wheel-of-fortune style lands on one.

Add titles

Center photos

Have something that says "click another choice to keep playing"

Have an option to have the user type in the opponents name.

Input a tracker that counts wins or losses in a row, displays your highest amount won in a row and highest amount lost in a row,
    and a message if you hit like 10 or something

Try out some sort of machine learning: counter tracks users choices. This somehow affects the users choice. For example, now it is chosing from my array of 1-3. Instead, have a "randomizer" function with a given list. Rock=1 / Paper=2 / Scissors=3. When user presses 1, it changes the list (for which the opponents choice is taken from) from 1,2,3 to 1,2,2,3. So that if a user keeps pressing 1, it is more and more likely the CPU choses paper (and wins). Maybe it doesn't do this every time, but for example, every 3times user choses scissors, it adds an extra rock to the list of choices. so if user presses scissors 6 times, the cpu choices are (rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors).

Using illustrator, make simple logos for each opponent choice and (?)user choice(?)
